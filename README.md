Bamazon

This is an Amazon Marketplace style CLI app.  It makes queries to a locally stored database using MYSQL.  It has 3 different views, set up for a customer, manager and supervisor.  Depending on the view chosen(potentially requiring login credentials), the user will have different menu options and abilities to alter the database.

For a video demo of the application for all 3 views, please visit:
